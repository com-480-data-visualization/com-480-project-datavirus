## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### 1.1 Dataset

The dataset is a intern dataset provided by [dlab]( https://dlab.epfl.ch/ ) on YouTube channel and videos metadata. It was crawled using a pool of 164,649 english channels with more than 10k subscribers (retrieved from [`channelcrawler.com`]( https://channelcrawler.com/ )). It provides a snapshot on YouTube data at the end of 2019.

The data as already been preprocessed and cleaned internally and is available as a 6.4gb feather DataFrame, so it is directly usable for visualization purpose and allows for further data exploration.

### 1.2 Problematic

The main idea is to provide a highly interactive visualization of YouTube data to accompany a paper submission from a [PhD student at dlab]( https://manoelhortaribeiro.github.io/ ). The research is still in its early stage but we aim to conduct a large scale longitudinal study examining the metadata of English speaking YouTuber's videos over time. The research questions* are:

1. What are the kinds of content and formats that prospered on YouTube through the years?
2. How have content creation practices changed through years on YouTube?

The main challenge will be to provide a way to explore the different axes: categories, number of likes, duration of the video, ... in an interactive manner and provide ways to compare the trends across time.
